        <h2>The Tigray Crisis</h2>
        <p>The Tigray crisis, beginning in 2020, brought unimaginable suffering to the people of Tigray, Ethiopia. Eritrean and Ethiopian forces unleashed violence, looting homes, killing young men, and committing atrocities against women and girls. Essential services like hospitals, electricity, and internet were cut off, leaving communities in despair. This website shares a survivor's story and calls for peace, justice, and support for displaced Tigrayans.</p>

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>The conflict consumed our rural community. In the chaos, Eritrean and Ethiopian forces targeted young men aged 18–50, leaving death and devastation wherever they passed. Women and girls endured horrific sexual violence. Our livelihoods vanished homes looted, livestock slaughtered, and we were cut off from hospitals, electricity, and the internet.</p>
        <p>On November 13, 2020, our ordeal intensified. As heavy artillery rained down, we hid in the valleys and mountains, clutching our loved ones. Sixteen people, mostly mothers and children, died that day, their cries of pain echoing without the hope of any medical help. I will never forget the sight of their funerals: only 35 people were able to carry the bodies to the church. That image haunts me whenever I hear of new conflict.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, soldiers repeatedly returned to loot, to kill, or to rape. Each time, we ran forced from our home again and again. Displacement and fear became our daily life for eight months.</p>
        <p>We starved. My mother would grind wheat with stones so we could eat and make flour; we even used leaves for soap. To survive, I turned to the land, digging and irrigating by hand. One day, while working in the fields, Eritrean soldiers found me and started shooting. I escaped, running through the valleys home, grateful to survive as the bullets whistled past.</p>
        <p>Thousands of people from western, southern, and northern part of Tigray fled to Mekelle, sudan and other regions, escaping violence in western, southern, and northern Tigray. Despite despair, we survived by clinging to hope and helping each other. The memory of the funerals, the hunger, and the terror remains vivid, but so does our plea:</p>

        <h2>Call to Justice</h2>
        <p>The Tigray crisis left countless scars, with thousands of young men killed and women and girls subjected to rape and violence by Eritrean and Ethiopian forces. We demand justice for those who lost their lives, for the survivors enduring trauma, and for the families torn apart. We call on the international community, including the United Nations and human rights organizations, to investigate these atrocities, hold perpetrators accountable, and ensure such violations never happen again.</p>

        <h2>Choose Peace, Support Survivors</h2>
        <p>The Tigray crisis shows the cost of division and conflict. For five years, displaced Tigrayans in Mekelle, other parts of Tigray, and Sudan have lived under harsh conditions, exposed to rain and sun with little shelter or aid. We urge the world to provide humanitarian support, protect these immigrants, and help rebuild their lives. Let’s work together to promote peace, support survivors, and ensure such tragedies never happen again. Share this story and advocate for humanity.</p>
